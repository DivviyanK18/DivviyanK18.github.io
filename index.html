        <h2>Program & Courses</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree of Commerce - Business Technology Management at Toronto Metropolitan University. This program has a strong mix of business management and technology courses that will prepare me for the business world as it transitions more with the technology field.</p>

        <h3>Most Useful Course:</h3>
        <p><strong>Fundamentals of Programming (ITM200)</strong> – I really enjoyed this Fundamentals of Programming course that I did in my 2nd year in BTM. I've always loved software and coding since I was a child, and this course helped build on my previous knowledge of Python and other coding basics. It helped me become more confident in programming and sparked a stronger love for it.</p>
