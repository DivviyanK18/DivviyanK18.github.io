    <h2>SEO and SMO Techniques</h2>
    <h3>SEO Techniques</h3>
    <p><strong>Heading Tags:</strong> Heading tags are a useful SEO technique that helps "provide structure to a piece of content" (SitePoint, 2024). This organization of the content not only allows the reader to better navigate and understand your website, but it also allows search engines to understand it. This in turn would increase the relevance of your website in searches done.</p>
    <p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Meta descriptions are a valuable SEO technique that helps increase user engagement and click-through rates on your website. "This is key as the more people click on your result, Google considers you to be a good result." (Toonen, 2023). It is typically a brief description of your website, including keywords and phrases that someone could search for, and it's utilized to entice users into clicking on your website link.</p>
    <p><strong>Page Title:</strong> A good page title is really important as it is an SEO technique which is the first thing that users see when searching for something. They should contain keywords that people may search for, and be descriptive to improve the website's search engine rankings. "Page titles are used by search engines more than 80% of the time for the titles used in their search results" (Screaming Frog, 2024)</p>
    <h3>SMO Techniques</h3>
    <p><strong>Contests and Giveaways:</strong> Holding contests and announcing giveaways are strong SMO techniques that several companies and organizations use to draw attention to themselves. Everyone loves hearing about a giveaway, and they tend to share it with the people around them as well. More traffic will come to your website since "social media contests are an effective way to engage with your audience and increase brand awareness" (Faster Capital, 2024)</p>
    <p><strong>Social Sharing Buttons:</strong> Having social media sharing buttons encourages users to share your website's content with their platforms. This is a valuable asset as it spreads more awareness about your brand to others as "with a single click, visitors can endorse or share an article with their entire social network" (MightyBytes, 2022)</p>
    <p><strong>Optimized Social Profiles:</strong> Having a well-optimized social profile is a good SMO technique that helps drive traffic to your website. Keeping up-to-date information and being consistent with the design in relation to the website will help the website appear more in searches on social media. An optimized profile will enhance searchability on both search engines and social platforms.</p>
